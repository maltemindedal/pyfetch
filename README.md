# PyFetch: A Lightweight HTTP CLI and Library

A lightweight command-line interface and Python library for making HTTP requests.
Built with Python, this tool provides an easy way to make GET, POST, PUT, PATCH,
DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests with support for JSON data, customizable timeouts,
automatic retries on failures, and a verbose mode for detailed logging.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface
- Can be used as a Python library
- Case-insensitive commands (GET/get, POST/post etc.)
- Support for GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
- JSON data handling for POST requests
- Optional progress bars for large file downloads (>5MB)
- Customizable timeout settings and automatic retries on failures
- Verbose mode for debugging: logs requests and responses
- Detailed response output
  - Status code
  - Response headers
  - Response body (pretty-printed if JSON)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built-in help system

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv _(recommended)_

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maltemindedal/PyFetch.git
cd PyFetch
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment _(recommended)_:

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Library Usage

You can also use PyFetch as a library in your Python projects.

### Creating a Client

First, import and create an instance of the `HTTPClient`:

```python
from PyFetch.http_client import HTTPClient

client = HTTPClient(timeout=30, retries=3, verbose=False)
```

### Making Requests

You can then use the client to make HTTP requests:

```python
# Make a GET request
response = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print(response.json())

# Make a POST request with JSON data
data = {"key": "value"}
response = client.post("https://httpbin.org/post", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### Error Handling

The client raises specific exceptions for different types of errors:

```python
from PyFetch.exceptions import HTTPClientError, HTTPConnectionError

try:
    response = client.get("https://a-non-existent-domain.com")
except HTTPConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
except HTTPClientError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## CLI Usage

### Example Commands

```bash
# 1. Normal GET request:
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/get

# 2. GET request with progress bar (for files larger than 5MB):
pyfetch GET https://example.com/large-file.zip --progress

# 3. GET request with verbose mode to see retry logs and detailed output:
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/get --verbose

# 4. GET request with a custom header (e.g., Authorization token):
pyfetch GET https://httpbin.org/headers -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"

# 5. POST request with JSON data and custom Content-Type header:
pyfetch POST https://httpbin.org/post -d '{"key": "value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 6. PUT request example to update a resource:
pyfetch PUT https://httpbin.org/put -d '{"name": "New Name"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 7. PATCH request example to partially update a resource:
pyfetch PATCH https://httpbin.org/patch -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# 8. DELETE request to remove a resource:
pyfetch DELETE https://httpbin.org/delete

# 9. HEAD request to fetch only headers:
pyfetch HEAD https://httpbin.org/get

# 10. OPTIONS request to check allowed methods:
pyfetch OPTIONS https://httpbin.org/get

# 11. Show help message:
pyfetch HELP
```

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Python's unittest framework.

### Running Tests

Run all tests using either of these commands:

```bash
# Using Python's unittest discover
python -m unittest discover tests

# Using pip's installed test suite
pip install -e .
python setup.py test
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- HTTP client functionality
- CLI commands and arguments
- Error handling and exceptions
- Input validation
- Response processing

### Writing Tests

Tests are organized in three main files:

- `tests/test_cli.py` - Command-line interface tests
- `tests/test_http_client.py` - HTTP client functionality tests
- `tests/test_exceptions.py` - Exception handling tests

To add new tests:

1. Choose the appropriate test file based on functionality
2. Create a new test method in the relevant test class
3. Use unittest assertions to verify behavior
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
